## Description

A **Race Car** that learns to drive! Built using **NEAT** and **Pygame** written in **Python**. 
NEAT stands for neuro evolution of augmenting topologies and is a genetic algorithm that creates artificial neural networks.

## Installation
Requirements: You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and preferably a code editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

1. Clone the repository 
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned, e.g., `C:\Users\Max\PycharmProjects\DriveAI`
3. Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install pygame by running the following commands in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv #This creates a virtual environment
    venv\Scripts\activate #This activates the virtual environment
    pip install -r requirements.txt #This installs the required libraries
    ```
4. Run the game by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
Note on PyCharm: Often PyCharm detects the requirements and asks you to install them and create a virtual env.

Afterwards, the interpreter will be set to the virtual environment, and you can run the game by clicking the green play button in the top right corner.

## Controls
- You don't need to control the car. The AI will do that for you :)
